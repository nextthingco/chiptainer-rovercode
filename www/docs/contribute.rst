===========

There is lots of fun work to be done!

Head on over to `the rovercode github <https://github.com/aninternetof/rovercode>`_.
We use ZenHub to improve GitHub's agile management, so `install it <https://www.zenhub.com/>`_,
then visit the `boards` tab to find a fun card in the backlog. Or `submit a new
card <https://github.com/aninternetof/rovercode/issues/new>`_ for a bug or cool
new feature idea.

And remember, you can do all these same things for
`rovercode-web <https://github.com/aninternetof/rovercode-web>`_.

Chat with us on `the rovercode Slack channel <http://chat.rovercode.com>`_.

Follow the `the code of conduct <code_of_conduct.html>`_.
